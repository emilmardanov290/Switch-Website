# Construction-Website

This project is based on an open-source HTML and CSS template, which I used as a foundation. The goal was to practice front-end development by working with an existing template, understanding its structure, and customizing it to create a visually appealing and functional site focused on construction projects, services, and company information. I adapted the layout, colors, fonts, and sections to make PSD-template alive, adding elements like project showcases, service descriptions, and client testimonials. This process helped me improve my skills in **HTML structure, CSS styling, and responsive design**.

## Features

- Sections for services, projects, and client testimonials  
- Fully responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile
